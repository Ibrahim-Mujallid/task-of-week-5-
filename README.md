# task-of-week-5-
'FIRST TASK' 
Design circuit which control motor using transistor,the transistor will cut the current which deliverd to the motor so mainly the transistor here act as a switch 
also by using arduino the arduino will give the transistor current and will cut it as shown in the code 
there two picture one for the motor turn off and aother one for the motor turn on 

'SECOND TASK' 
Design cercuit to regulate Voltage from 12 V to 5 V as showm in the multimeter 

used Components in the First task : Arduino Uno - NPN transistor - 9V Battery - 1 kΩ Resistor - DC Motor


used Components in the second task : Diode - 100 nF Capacitors - 220 Ω Resistor - Voltage Multimeter - Light bulb - power supply - 5V Regulator [LM7805]
